working with loggers and reflection:
1. create one class including methods with all access modifiers and invoke all private and protected from second class.
2. output all warnings/exceptions in log file
3. use reflection and loggers and exceptions need to pe specified ( NO MORE Exceptions e and NEVER do THAT main() throws ... )

* create different parameters in methods and invoke code should not depend on type and amount of parameters
(use recursion for getting to default constructor)
